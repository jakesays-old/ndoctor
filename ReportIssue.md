# Introduction: #

While nDoctor is still in beta and heavy development, the issue reporting is done manually. As soon as the final version is released, a built-in reporting engine will be implemented.

# Prerequisites: #
## Get a Gmail address ##
> Read the instructions [HERE](GetGmail.md)

## Get the logs of the application ##

The logs of nDoctor are stored in a generic place. To get them, follow these steps:

  * Click in the **Windows Button**
  * In the search box (showed by the arrow) enter this text **`%appdata%\Probel\nDoctor\Logs`** and press _ENTER_
  * The log file is named **nDoctor.log** or, if you don't display the file extention -which is the default configuration, just **nDoctor** (See the print screen below)

# How to report: #

First of all, I'd like to ask you to be really attentive in the way you write the issue. **Be clear, review your text before posting and keep an eye on the grammar and the spelling**. The clearer and cleaner you are, the better I can fix your problem and become your _hero_ ;)

  * Go to the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/ndoctor/issues/list)
  * Sign in with your Gmail account (If you're worried about privacy, please read the [Google Privacy Agreement](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)).
