Here, you will find the different ways you can use to find a patient.

To load a session for a patient, you just need to double click on the patient you want in the results.

# The search tools #
## The ten most used patients ##

Each time you open a session of a patient, nDoctor will increment an internal counter. So this search will find the ten first patients that was loaded the most often.
## The basic search ##

This search is done on the name and/or the surname. The way the search is done can be changed in the settings.

Bear in mind that when triggering a search, nDoctor will find patient that contains the specified text in the name and/or the surname.

If you search patient with this criteria "**mar**" for the surname. It'll find:

  * John **Mar**-tellano
  * Luke Tol-**mar**
  * Sylvia To-**mar**-dson

  * Save your changes

### Use the advanced search ###

  * Select the behaviour of the search
    * **Select if ALL criterion are satisfied**: Means that a patient will appear in the result only if he/she satisfied ALL the specified criterion. In other words it is a **logical AND** search
    * **Select if AT LEAST one criteria is satisfied**: Means that a patient will appear in the result if he/she satisfies AT LEAST one (or more) criteria. In other words it is a logical OR search
  * Check the criterion you want to use in the search and specify a search value.
  * Execute the search by clicking on _Search_

### Remarks ###
This kind of search is slower than the others because the design is done in such a way that a lot of data should be loaded in memory.
