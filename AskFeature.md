# Introduction #

The best thing about development, it is that you can change the code and always improve the solution. Which is a lot harder when you're an architect building a house ;)

This is why there's a forum to discuss about what to improve in nDoctor. The great advantage of the Google Groups is that you can use it just by using your Gmail account. For instance, you can answer to a post just by answering the email you've received from the forum.
