#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

The Domain has some AOP basic features as it uses Castle Dynamic Proxy.

= How it works =

Before any call a of component's methods, all the configured dynamic proxies are executed. By default there's a proxy for:
 * Authorisation: it'll check whether the connected user can execute this feature and throw an exception if he/she isn't granted to.
 * Session checking: before any execution of a component's method, a proxy checks if the nHibernate session is configured and throws an exception is it's not configured.
 * Logging and historisation: So far, a log4net logger writes any call of component's methods.

= How to tweak it? =

== Session checking ==
You can avoid the execution of the session check by decorating your method with `InspectionIgnored` attribute

== Authorisation ==
You an decorate the methods of the DAL with the `Granted` attributes that uses a string that defines the granted task.
