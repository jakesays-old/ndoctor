==== What is a doctor doubloon? ====
This is a doctor that is inserted multiple times in the database. For nDoctor such doctors are different event if, from the business point of view they are the same.

This tool will try to spot doubloons flowing this rule: two doctors are suspected to be the same when their name, surname and specialisation have the same spelling (no matter the case).
