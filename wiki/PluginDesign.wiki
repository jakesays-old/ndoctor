= Plugins =

The plugin module has these roles
 * It loads the plugins from the repository.
 * It validates the plugins. That's, it checks if the version of the plugin is compatible with the version of the plugins host.

The plugin repository is a directory _Plugins_ in the application root. Each plugin has:
 * Its own directory that contains
  * The plugin dll and all the needed files
  * a config file that contains the dependency information.

The config file is a XML file that contains the configuration of the plugin
