= Plugins - Client Side=

The module manager has these two main roles:
 * It loads plugins from the repository. MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework) was chosen to manage the plugins. 
 * It checks if the services the plugin will call exists in the server. 

The plugin repository is a directory _Plugins_ in the application root. Each plugin has:
 * It own directory that contains
  * The plugin dll and all the needed files
  * a _.pic_ file that contains the dependency information.

The _.pic_ file is a XML file that contains:
 * The Guid that represents the component used at server side.
 * The Version the component should have
 * A constraint that will modify the scope of the version. The constraint can be
  * *Strict*, that's a plugin is selected only if the component has the specified version
  * *Minimum*, that's a plugin is selected if the component has at least the specified version
