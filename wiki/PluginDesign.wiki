= Plugins =

The module manager has these two main roles:
 * It loads plugins from the repository. MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework) was chosen to manage the plugins. 

The plugin repository is a directory _Plugins_ in the application root. Each plugin has:
 * It own directory that contains
  * The plugin dll and all the needed files
  * a config file that contains the dependency information.

The config file is a XML file that contains the configuration of the plugin
