= Concepts =

The GUI is divided into different parts
 # The main menu: It contains all the application wide menu such as:  
  # Home: Contains a menu group to manage a patient session and another menu group to manage the patient's managers
  # Tools: Contains tools to improve the user experience of nDoctor.
  # Help: Contains help information about nDoctor.
 # The contextual menu: this menu changes depending on the selected workbench. It should be a toolbox or a contextual menu if it is a ribbon menu (as in Ms Office) 
 # The status: Provide non interactive logs. That's, information about the state of the application.
 # Workbench: it is the workbench of the selected item of the selected module. Here you manage the data of nDoctor.
