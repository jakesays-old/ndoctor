  # Home: Contains a menu group to manage a patient session and another menu group to manage the patient's managers
  # [`Deprecated`] Tools: Contains tools to improve the user experience of nDoctor. All the items that should be in this menu are moved in the global menu.
  # Help: Contains help information about nDoctor.
 # The contextual menu: this menu changes depending on the selected workbench.
 # The status: Provide non interactive logs. That's, information about the state of the application.
 # Workbench: it is the workbench of the selected item of the selected module. Here you manage the data of nDoctor.
