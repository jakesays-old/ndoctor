= Configure the development machine =
Before starting development, you have to configure your machine as follow:

== Checkout the code: ==

 # Ask the `write` privilege to the project owner sending him a mail to `ndoctor(dot)software(at)gmail(dot)com` explaining why you'd like to be part of the team.
 # Check out the code at this address `https://ndoctor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`

== Configure TortoiseSVN: ==

 # Configure SubWCRev for automatic versionning based on SVN revision number:
  # Install TortoiseSVN
  # Set SubWCRev path in the envoronment variable
   # `Windows+Break`
   # Click on "Change Settings"
   # Click on "Environment Variables" 
   # Edit PATH (On my machine I add "`C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin`"

== Install the libraries that are not configured with !NuGet: ==
Simply install:
 * [http://wpf.codeplex.com/ WPF Toolkit]
 * [http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/ WPF Toolkit extended]
 * [http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11877 Microsoft Ribbon for WPF]

== Import the plugin project template: ==
Drop the file 
  * `[working copy]\tools\Probel.NDoctor.Template.zip` 
into 
  * `%userprofile%\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\`

== Troubleshooting: ==
=== Castle Dynamic Proxy: ==
For an unknown reason, this libraries wasn't recognised anymore when I made a fresh checkout on a new machine.
To fix it I:
 # Edit the file `packages.config` of the project `Probel.NDoctor.Domain.Components`
 # Removed the entry `<package id="Castle.Core" version="3.0.0.4001" />`
 # Right clicked on `Reference` directory on this project
 # Reinstalled the `Castle Dynamic Proxy`
