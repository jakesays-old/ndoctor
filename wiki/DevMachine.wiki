= Configure the development machine =
Before starting development, you have to configure your machine as follow:

== Checkout the code: ==

 # Ask the `write` privilege to the project owner sending him a mail to *`ndoctor(dot)software(at)gmail(dot)com`* explaining why you'd like to be part of the team.
 # Check out the code at this address `https://ndoctor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`

== Visual Studio: ==

=== Add code snippets ==
Copy the `*.snippet` files 
 * from: `%workingcopy%`\tools\Snippets
 * to  : `%userprofile%\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets`
=== Import the plugin project template: ===
Drop the file 
 * `[working copy]\tools\Probel.NDoctor.Template.zip` 
 * into :`%userprofile%\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\`

== Configure TortoiseSVN: ==

 # Configure SubWCRev for automatic versionning based on SVN revision number:
  # Install TortoiseSVN
  # Set SubWCRev path in the envoronment variable
   # `Windows+Break`
   # Click on "Change Settings"
   # Click on "Environment Variables" 
   # Edit PATH (On my machine I add "`C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin`"

== Configure nArrange: ==

nArrange is a little tool to beautify the code. By default, it is triggered every time you execute the nAnt build file.

To add this tool in Visual Studio follow these steps:
 # In Visual Studion go to Tools\External Tools
 # Fill the windows as follow:
   # Title            : nArrange (or whatever name you want)
   # Command          : `%WorkingCopy%\tools\NArrange\narrange-console.exe`
   # Arguments        : `$(SolutionFileName) /b`
   # Initial directory: `$(SolutionDir)`


== Configure nAnt: ==
 # Download [http://nant.sourceforge.net/ nAnt] and [http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net/ nAnt contrib]. 
 # Copy the downoaded files into `%programfiles%\nAnt` (or whatever directory) and copy the nAnt Contrib files from `bin` directory into the nAnt directory you've created.
 # Update the Environment Variables to allow nAnt.exe to be accessible from everywhere
 # Configure Visual Studio to work with build files.
