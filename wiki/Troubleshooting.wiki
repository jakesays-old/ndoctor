= Troubleshooting: =
Here's the list of some problem you could encounter when installing a development machine.

== nAnt is crashing displaying a security error message: ==
You have to create yourself the `nAnt` directory into `%programfiles%` and copy/paste the nAnt files into the freshly created directory. In this way, Windows 7 doesn't believe these files are untrusted internet files.

== Castle Dynamic Proxy: ==
For an unknown reason, this librarie wasn't recognised anymore when I made a fresh checkout on a new machine.
To fix it I:
 # Edit the file `packages.config` of the project `Probel.NDoctor.Domain.Components`
 # Removed the entry `<package id="Castle.Core" version="3.0.0.4001" />`
 # Right clicked on `Reference` directory on this project
 # Reinstalled the `Castle Dynamic Proxy` with !NuGet

== AnkhSVN is not working with Visual Studio: ==
You just need to enable SVN as source control as explained [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3869404/ankhsvn-not-integrated-to-visual-studio-2010 here]

== Windows 7 UAC always ask me to grant execution of Pencil or Everything ==
