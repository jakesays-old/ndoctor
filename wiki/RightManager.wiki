= Introduction =
This module allows the user that is granted to utilise this plugin to administrate the rights of the application.

The role manager is divided into two parts: the roles and the tasks.

A *task* is an action the connected user can perform or not depending on the assigned *role* he/she has. nDoctor has a built-in list of tasks that cannot be modified by users.

A *role* is a batch of tasks. A user has an assigned role that allows him/her that grants certain actions. Any administrator user can create roles.
